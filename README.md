## The implementation of intelligent drying technology in a semi-hybrid solar dome dyer using IoT-based fuzzy logic algoritm

## Project Description
Our project introduces a implementation of intelligent drying technology in a solar dome dyer using IoT-based fuzzy logic algoritm. This innovative solution implements and combines fuzzy logic technology to assist users in accelerating the drying process, maintaining stable temperatures within the dome chamber, and ensuring consistent drying quality.

## Setup
### Prerequisite Packages (Dependencies)
- streamlit
- pandas
- streamlit-echarts
- streamlit-autorefresh


## Dokumentation
This documentation compiles the test results obtained during implementation in the integrated solar dome dryer system. Daily monitoring is conducted to check the dome's internal temperature conditions, preventing errors and avoiding damage to the dried materials.
